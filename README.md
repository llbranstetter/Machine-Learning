# Machine Learning 2025
A respsitory of work on classification models for machine learning and the basic math behind common ML models
This contains classwork from my Machine Learning class from winter 2025. 
There are 4 homework assignmetns focusing on applying the mathematical concepts of machine learning to functions in python and a final project that focuses on hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, and model analysis methods using SKlearn's classification models on real Amazon review data.
All projects are done in Jupyter Notebook.
